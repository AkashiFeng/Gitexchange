                    <p>The <?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?> trading platform is currently in beta (testing phase). By using this Site, and further by registering to use our Service, you "You‚Äù are agreeing to accept and comply with the terms and conditions of use stated below ("Terms of Use"). You should read the entire Terms of Use carefully before you use this web site ("Site") or any of the services of this Site.</p>
                    <p>As used herein, "<?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?>" refers to the company, including without limitation thereby, its owners, directors, investors, employees or other related parties. Depending upon context, "<?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?>" may also refer to the services, products, Site, content or other materials (collectively, "Materials") provided by <?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?>.</p>
                    <p>The Service operated by <?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?> allows buyers ("Buyers") and sellers ("Sellers"), to buy and sell the Digital currency known as "Bitcoin" or any other digital currency that <?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?>'s platform allows to trade through its platform.</p>
                    <p>The Service operated by <?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?> also allows all registered users of the Service ("Users") to:</p>
                    <p>Depending on Your country of residence, you may not be able to use all the functions of the Site. It is your responsibility to follow those rules and laws in your country of residence and/or country from which you access this Site and Services. As long as you agree to and actually comply with these Terms of Service, <?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?> grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited rights to enter and use the Site and the Service.</p>
                    <p><b>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF USE AND CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS THIS SITE AND DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.</b></p>
                    <p>By opening an account to use the Service ("Account"), you expressly represent and warrant:</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; 1. You have accepted these Terms; and</p>
                    <p>&nbsp; 2. You are at least 18 years of age and have the full capacity to accept these Terms and enter into a transaction involving Bitcoin or any digital currency.</p>
                    <h5 class="m-b-1em">Risks</h5>
                    <p>The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency - virtual or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on through the trading platform.</p>
                    <p>Bitcoin trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or commodities such as gold or silver, Bitcoin is a unique kind of currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of Bitcoin in a crisis or issue more currency, or reverse transactions.</p>
                    <p>Instead, Bitcoin is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency traded between firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.</p>
                    <p>There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.</p>
                    <p>You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Bitcoin.</p>
                    <p>We have partnered with Crypto Capital Corp to manage all of the KYC/AML and Fiat transactions on our behalf. Please refer to their site at cryptocapital.co for more information on the services they provide.</p>

If you deactivate your <?= $CFG->exchange_name; ?> account, we will mark your account in our database as "Deactivate" but will keep your account information in our database.
